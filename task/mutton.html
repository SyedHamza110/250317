    <p1>Mutton meat, which comes from mature sheep, is a flavorful and rich protein source enjoyed in many cuisines worldwide. Known for its robust taste and tender texture when cooked properly, mutton is often used in hearty dishes like stews, curries, and roasts. Unlike lamb, which comes from younger sheep, mutton has a stronger, more distinct flavor that some find more appealing. It is packed with essential nutrients, including high-quality protein, iron, zinc, and vitamins such as B12. Mutton is popular in countries like India, Pakistan, and the Middle East, where it is seasoned with a variety of spices to enhance its bold flavor. Due to its slightly tougher texture compared to lamb, mutton often benefits from slow-cooking methods to break down the fibers and achieve a tender, melt-in-the-mouth consistency.</p1>
