    <p1>Onions are a versatile and flavorful vegetable that offer a wide range of health benefits. Rich in antioxidants, particularly quercetin, onions help protect the body from oxidative stress and inflammation, which can reduce the risk of chronic diseases like heart disease and cancer. They are also a good source of vitamins such as vitamin C, which boosts the immune system, and B vitamins, which support energy production and brain function. Onions are high in fiber, aiding in digestion and promoting gut health. Their natural compounds, like sulfur, can help improve heart health by reducing blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Additionally, onions have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties, which may help improve overall immune function and fight infections. Incorporating onions into your diet can support better digestion, heart health, and immune function while adding a delicious depth of flavor to a variety of dishes.</p1>
